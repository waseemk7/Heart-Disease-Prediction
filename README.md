# Heart-Disease-Prediction
About This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Attribute Information:

age = age in years

sex= (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp = chest pain type

trestbpsr = esting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs = (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg = resting electrocardiographic results

thalach = maximum heart rate achieved

exang = exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal = 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

target = 1 or 0
